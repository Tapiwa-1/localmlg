## Project Overview
A voluntary project build with Laravel and VueJs with the help of InertiaJs to solve various challenges in Zimbambe. The system is designed to capture information about chiefs, villageheads and headmans in Zimbabwe. The essence of the project is to maintain confidentiality, availability and integrity of the information. Such information was stored in files and as a result there was data duplication, data inconsistence and data redundancy. The project is aimed on who will captured the information, who enters the users into the system and who views the information.
